This directory includes all reference models as desribed in "Pre-Mission
InSights on the Interior of Mars" by Smrekar et al. in Space Science Reviews.

There are 13 models, and each one is available in 2 formats.  The files with
the extension bm are in a format compatible with the AxiSem wave propagation
code, while the .deck models are compatible with the normal mode code MINEOS.

The models are all plotted in figure 19 of the paper.
